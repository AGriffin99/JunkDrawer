    Description: JQuery is a very different and interesting way to integrate, however it was fun to experiment with. I belive it would have worked better if the CDN worked correctly and the way that the js linked to the html via external files. But oh welll! Back to the narrative, this narrative is of how we are the ones disturbing the bears. Typically people believe bears are the problems but however did anyone think that maybe we are the ones destroying their habitats and taking away their homes?</p>
